# 🎮 Tweenky — A Fast-Paced Reflex & Rhythm Game

**Tweenky** is a vibrant, fast-paced arcade game that blends rhythm, reflex, and color-matching mechanics into an addictively simple gameplay loop. Tap, slide, or time your moves perfectly to rack up points, unlock skins, and climb the global leaderboard.

## 🚀 Concept

In **Tweenky**, you control a shape (or “tween”) that pulses to the beat of an original soundtrack. Obstacles and beats approach from all directions — your goal is to react in sync with the rhythm, hit the right colors, and survive the ever-accelerating pace.

> Think: **Geometry Dash** meets **Beat Saber**, but in a colorful, circular arena.
